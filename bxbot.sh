# You need the Java runtime installed - Oracle JDK 1.8 is supported.
#
# This script expects all the jar files to live in the LIB_DIR.
#
# You can change the bxbot_core var to the version you want to run; it has been defaulted to the current release.
#
# You can start, stop, and query the bot's status: ./bxbot.sh [start|stop|status]
